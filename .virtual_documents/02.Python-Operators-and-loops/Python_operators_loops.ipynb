# python operators are special symbols that carry out arithmetic or logical computation.
# The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.
# Here are some common types of operators in Python:
# 1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, //
# 2. Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# 3. Logical Operators: and, or, not
# 4. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
# 5. Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
# 6. Membership Operators: in, not in
# 7. Identity Operators: is, is not
# Below are examples of each type of operator:

# Python if-else statement is a conditional statement that allows you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. if-else statements are essential for controlling the flow of your program based on different conditions. They allow you to make decisions and execute specific code blocks accordingly.
# if-else statements are widely used in various applications, including data validation, user input handling, and decision-making processes.
# The syntax of an if-else statement is as follows:

# if condition:
#     # code to be executed if condition is true
# else:
#     # code to be executed if condition is false


# Example of if-else statement in Python:
x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("x is a positive number.")
else:
    print("x is not a positive number.")


# You can also use elif (short for else if) to check multiple conditions:
y = 0
if y > 0:
    print("y is a positive number.")
elif y == 0:
    print("y is zero.")
else:
    print("y is a negative number.")
# In this example, the elif statement checks if y is equal to 0. If neither the if nor the elif condition is true, the else block executes.


# nested if-else statements can also be used to check multiple conditions within another condition:
z = -5
if z >= 0:
    if z == 0:
        print("z is zero.")
    else:
        print("z is a positive number.")
else:
    print("z is a negative number.")
# This code showcases how to use nested if-else statements in Python for more complex conditional logic.


# if-else statements can also be combined with logical operators to create more complex conditions:
a = 15
if a > 10 and a < 20:
    print("a is between 10 and 20.")
else:
    print("a is not between 10 and 20.")
# here, If both conditions are true, it prints "a is between 10 and 20." Otherwise, it prints "a is not between 10 and 20."


#else-if ladder can be used to check multiple conditions in a sequential manner:
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")

# Python while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
# The syntax of a while loop is as follows:
# while condition:
#     # code to be executed repeatedly
# Example of while loop in Python:
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1

# In this example, the while loop continues to execute as long as the value of count is less than 5.
# Inside the loop, it prints the current value of count and then increments count by 1.
# The loop will terminate once count reaches 5.

# python while loops are useful for scenarios where you want to repeat an action until a certain condition is met.
# Be cautious to avoid infinite loops by ensuring that the condition will eventually become false.
# python while loops can also include else statements that execute when the loop condition becomes false.
# Example of while loop with else statement:
num = 1
while num <= 3:
    print("Number:", num)
    num += 1
else:
    print("Loop has ended.")
# In this example, the else block executes after the while loop finishes iterating.
# This code demonstrates the use of while loops in Python for repeated execution based on a condition.

# python while loops can also be nested within other loops to create more complex logic:
i = 1
while i <= 3:
    j = 1
    while j <= 2:
        print("i:", i, "j:", j)
        j += 1
    i += 1
# In this example, the outer while loop iterates through values of i from 1 to
# 3, and for each value of i, the inner while loop iterates through values of j from 1 to 2.
# This code showcases how to use nested while loops in Python for more complex iteration patterns.

#while loops can also be used with break and continue statements to control the flow of execution:
n = 1
while n <= 10:
    if n == 5:
        break  # Exit the loop when n is 5
    if n % 2 == 0:
        n += 1
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print("Odd Number:", n)
    n += 1
# In this example, the while loop iterates through numbers from 1 to 10.
# The break statement exits the loop when n reaches 5, and the continue statement skips even numbers, printing only odd numbers.
# This code demonstrates the use of break and continue statements within while loops in Python for controlling loop execution.

#while loops are essential for scenarios where you need to repeat actions until a specific condition is met.
# They are widely used in various applications, including data processing, user input handling, and more

# Python for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterable objects.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print("Fruit:", fruit)
# In this example, the for loop iterates over each element in the fruits list.
# For each iteration, it assigns the current element to the variable fruit and prints it.

# python for loops are useful for processing each item in a collection or performing repetitive tasks.
# python for loops can also be used with the range() function to generate a sequence of numbers
for i in range(5):
    print("Number:", i)
# In this example, the for loop iterates over a sequence of numbers generated by range(5), which produces numbers from 0 to 4.
# This code demonstrates the use of for loops in Python for iterating over sequences and ranges.
# python for loops can also include else statements that execute when the loop completes all iterations
for i in range(3):
    print("Iteration:", i)
else:
    print("Loop has ended.")
# In this example, the else block executes after the for loop finishes iterating through all values.
# This code showcases how to use for loops in Python for repeated execution based on sequences and ranges.

#for loops can also be nested within other loops to create more complex logic:
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 3):
        print("i:", i, "j:", j)
# In this example, the outer for loop iterates through values of i from 1 to 3, and for each value of i, the inner for loop iterates through values of j from 1 to 2.

person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}
for key, value in person.items():
    print("Key:", key, "Value:", value)
# In this example, the for loop iterates over the key-value pairs in the person dictionary

# For each iteration, it assigns the current element to the variable num and prints it.
# This code demonstrates how to use for loops in Python to iterate over the elements in a set
#for loops can also use the enumerate() function to get both the index and value of elements in a sequence:

for index, color in enumerate(colors):
    print("Index:", index, "Color:", color)
# In this example, the for loop iterates over the colors list using the enumerate() function
# For each iteration, it assigns the current index to the variable index and the current color to the variable color, then prints them.

#for loops can also iterate over multiple sequences simultaneously using the zip() function:
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]
for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print("Name:", name, "Age:", age)
# In this example, the for loop iterates over the names and ages lists simultaneously using the zip() function.
